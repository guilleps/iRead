This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version **16.2.7**.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18.10.0**
- **npm** (included with Node)
- _(Optional but recommended)_ **nvm** for Node version management

## Setup (using nvm)

If you are using **nvm**, simply run the following commands from the project root:

```bash
nvm install 18.10.0
nvm use
npm install
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

npx ng generate component component-name
```

You can also use:
